Ultimate 64 Turbo Control Library
ultimate-uci-oscar64 -- https://github.com/xahmol/ultimate-uci-oscar64

Targets the U64-specific $D031 turbo speed register.
Firmware menu must have "Turbo Mode" set to "U64 Turbo Registers"
for detection to work correctly.

Detection method — CIA TOD timing against a hand-written assembly loop:
  uii_turbo_detect() calls uii_turbo_benchmark_delay() which uses CIA1 TOD
  (Time Of Day) as a real-time reference.  The measured function is a
  short, hand-written 6502 assembly loop (a standard borrow-based
  16-bit decrement-to-zero counter, #pragma optimize(0), __noinline)
  with a fixed, precisely computable cycle cost per count -- not a
  deliberately-unoptimised C loop.  Per guidance from Bart van
  Leeuwen (private correspondence, 2026-09-20): a short, tight,
  hand-written loop has far less timing jitter than compiler-
  generated code, even at -O0, so far less safety margin is needed
  around THRESHOLD_DETECT.  uii_turbo_detect() also runs one throwaway
  uii_turbo_benchmark_delay() pass immediately after setting the speed register,
  purely to let the FPGA clock-domain change settle before the real
  measurement starts.  The measured result (tenths of a second) is
  compared against a single threshold to confirm turbo is genuinely
  engaged.

Note: simple CIA timer B or VIC raster measurements do NOT work on
U64 because both are clocked at the CPU frequency — they track CPU
cycles, not real time.  CIA TOD advances at real 50/60 Hz regardless
of CPU speed, which is what uii_turbo_benchmark_delay()'s loop exploits.

This library deliberately does NOT try to classify 48 MHz vs 64 MHz
from the timing measurement -- that distinction is a hardware-model
fact (see below), and measuring it via elapsed time proved unreliable
in practice (same hardware, same speed setting, classified differently
across two consecutive runs -- the measurement sits too close to the
48-vs-64 boundary to trust). For the MHz ceiling, query
CTRL_CMD_GET_HWINFO's product-name string at the application level
instead: plain "Ultimate 64" is now ambiguous (see below), "Ultimate
64 Elite" (Elite I, no "-II") = ~48 MHz, "Ultimate 64-II" = ~64 MHz.
Gideon Zweijtzer confirmed this field of GET_HWINFO stays supported
long-term (only the command's separate SID-ID subpart is deprecated).
This is meant to be a compile-time-fixed identity string, not a
measurement. See src/main.c in UltimateDemo2026 for a worked example.

2026-09-23: revisited and closed. Tried a longer, continuous (single
CIA1-TOD reset/read, no per-pass reset) benchmark against a real
Ultimate 64-II at both the 48 MHz speed index and MAX, specifically to
see whether a long-enough loop could resolve the two tiers where a
single COUNT=0xFFFF pass can't (both read 0 tenths -- below the 100ms
quantization floor). Result: no. Elapsed times for the same speed
index and roughly-comparable loop lengths were themselves inconsistent
run to run (e.g. one run's 4x-shorter loop measured a *longer* elapsed
time than a prior run's longer loop, at nominally the same settings),
and both speed tiers measured far below their labeled MHz for any
multi-second continuous pass (effective throughput in the low single-
digit MHz range at a "48 MHz" or "64 MHz" setting). Most likely cause:
holding SEI for several seconds straight -- which every measurement in
this family requires, to keep other interrupt-driven activity from
disturbing the reading -- may itself trigger some real, unexplored
throttling or wait-state behavior on this hardware, rather than the
CPU genuinely sustaining its labeled clock throughout. Whatever the
mechanism, this confirms (with new, independent real-hardware data)
that CIA-TOD timing cannot be made to reliably resolve 48 vs 64 MHz,
not just that a single short pass lacks resolution -- a longer pass
makes the measurement less trustworthy, not more. Final decision:
GET_HWINFO's product string is the only signal this project uses for
MHz classification, permanently. The one known gap (plain "Ultimate
64" being ambiguous between C64U and genuine non-Elite U64) is not
being chased further either -- see src/main.c's classification comment
for the accepted tradeoff (only the distinct "Ultimate 64 Elite"
string is trusted for 48 MHz; everything else, including the ambiguous
bare string, defaults to 64 MHz -- so only a genuine non-Elite U64
owner ever sees a wrong label).

CONFIRMED (2026-09-20, real hardware): Commodore 64 Ultimate (C64U),
current Commodore firmware ("1.1"), reports plain "Ultimate 64" --
identical to the original non-Elite U64's string, not "C64 Ultimate"
as an earlier REST-API-sourced claim (2026-09-16) had it. Confirmed by
forum report + screenshot from a real C64U unit; matches what
UE2-C64U-Emulator had already shown running the same firmware image
(genuine result, not an emulator artifact -- that earlier uncertainty
is resolved). Since GET_HWINFO alone can't distinguish C64U (64 MHz)
from genuine non-Elite U64 (48 MHz) anymore, classification code needs
to pick a default for the ambiguous case -- UltimateDemo2026 now
defaults plain "Ultimate 64" to 64 MHz, since C64U is both the more
common case today and documented as 64 MHz-capable everywhere else;
genuine non-Elite U64 owners will see an optimistic label as the
accepted tradeoff. See src/main.c's own comment on this for the
worked example of that decision.

Supported hardware:
  Ultimate 64 original / Elite I  — max ~48 MHz
  Ultimate 64 Elite II / C64U     — max ~64 MHz

/*
  Run a short, hand-written 6502 assembly counting loop (a
  borrow-based 16-bit decrement-to-zero counter -- see ultimate_turbo_lib.c) and
  return elapsed time in CIA1 TOD tenths of a second (10ths; range
  0–99 for <10 s).

  The function uses #pragma optimize(0) and __noinline purely to stop
  the compiler from disturbing the hand-written __asm block or its
  surrounding hi/lo setup -- the cycle cost itself comes from the
  assembly, not from suppressing C optimisation. Each count costs a
  fixed, computable number of cycles (~20.016 avg -- see ultimate_turbo_lib.c),
  which gives CIA TOD enough time to advance with far less run-to-run
  jitter than a compiler-generated loop.

  Resets CIA1 TOD to 00:00.0 on entry and reads it on exit.
  SEI/CLI wraps the measurement. `count` is destroyed by the loop.

char uii_turbo_detect(void);
/*
  Detect whether turbo is genuinely engaged, via CIA TOD timing.

  Forces a clean 1 MHz baseline first (its own settle pass), then sets
  CPU to maximum speed and calls uii_turbo_benchmark_delay(COUNT) twice more --
  once as a throwaway pass to let the FPGA clock-domain change settle,
  once to measure. The elapsed time (CIA1 TOD tenths) is compared
  against a single threshold:

  Returns:
    TURBO_NOT_PRESENT  — elapsed ≥ THRESHOLD_DETECT (≈1 MHz, not engaged)
    TURBO_DETECTED     — elapsed <  THRESHOLD_DETECT (genuinely accelerated)

  Does NOT classify the MHz ceiling -- see the file header for why,
  and how to get that from CTRL_CMD_GET_HWINFO instead.

  The forced 1 MHz baseline pass exists because an auto-loaded .cfg's
  own Turbo Control setting can leave $D031 already at a non-zero speed
  index before this function ever runs -- jumping straight from that
  state to max speed was found to settle unreliably on real Ultimate
  64-II hardware (intermittent false TURBO_NOT_PRESENT, confirmed via
  c64bridge real-hardware testing, 2026-09-23). See ultimate_turbo_lib.c's own
  comment on this function for the full real-hardware finding.

  Restores $D031 to 1 MHz after measuring.
  Call once at startup; worst case (no turbo present) takes ~3.9s at
  1 MHz across the three uii_turbo_benchmark_delay() passes, ~0.05s if turbo is
  genuinely engaged.
